                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>An interesting story about CTU Buddy and the developers is that they wouldn't be here without the help of the students themselves. It was in fact the students who had planned all the details for CTU Buddy to take place. The developer of CTU Buddy was well known from the students themslves as he engaged in many online meetups with the students and was well known for creating his own dev tournaments amongst the students.
                    <p>The team was therefore recommended to CTU. CTU themselves were very unsure if I was able to take the task, but in the end, with the help of the students I was able to secure a spot in the development of CTU Buddy.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>The primary purpose for this website is simply to present, share,or display some information or content online.
                    The CTU Buddy page was made for students to be able to come to one central hub and be able to connect with another.</p>
                    <p>The CTU Buddy website is an interactive and easily accessible website.
                    The dev team plan to maintain CTU Buddy and are excited to be apart of CTU. We are open to suggestions that the students or even parents may have for our website</p>

                     <p>Jestin Engelbrecht</p>
                     <p>Yes, the team is only one member. Although he overcame many challenges and overcame the deadline. Jestin enjoyed working by himself and managed to get through work without the negatives of working in a team.</p>

                  <p class="roles-p">Jestin Engelbrecht, the only developer that worked on the project, was responsible for major responsibility with regards to maintaining and creating CTU Budyy</p>
                  <p class="roles-p">Jestin Engelbrecht ensured that the design of CTU Buddy was aestetically pleasing towards the students, to allow for engagement with CTU Buddy.

                  <p class="roles-p">Some of the roles Jestin Engelbrecht may have encountered was to ensure that the website was responsive and that the visual aspects of the website were up to te standards of the students.
